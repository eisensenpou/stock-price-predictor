Stock Price Predictor
Project Overview
The Stock Price Predictor is a machine learning-based project that predicts the future price of stocks based on historical data. This project leverages various machine learning algorithms to build predictive models, aiming to provide accurate forecasts for stock prices.

Features
Predicts stock prices using historical stock data.
Uses machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory).
Data visualizations to understand stock price trends.
User-friendly interface for easy interaction.

Installation

Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/eisensenpou/stock-price-predictor.git`


Navigate to the project directory:
`cd stock-price-predictor`


Install the required dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Ensure you have the necessary API keys or datasets for stock data, as specified in the project documentation.

Usage
To run the project:
Open the terminal and navigate to the project folder.
Run the prediction script:
```python predict_stock.py```
Follow the prompts to input stock symbols and other necessary parameters.
The script will output the predicted stock prices and visualizations.
